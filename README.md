# Operative AI workshop

Requirements:
* Docker on your machine.

If you don't have docker follow this instructions:</br>
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

To run the workshop do the following:
1. Go into CMD/Terminal/Powershell.
2. Run the ``docker run -p 8888:8888 --name operative-ai-workshop omeroperative/operative-ai-workshop``</br>
  In this docker, you will have a ready-to-go Jupyter environment with all the necessary Python libs.
3. On your local browser type in ``localhost:8888`` and the Jupyter lab will be open, there you can create new scripts and notebooks to run Python code.
4. On the left you'll see the folder ``operative-ai-workshop``, click on it and select the task, starting with 1-task.
</br>
<b>Note:</b> If you get stuck you can use hints in the notebook, ask questions, or even check online, BUT please know that this notebook is meant to show you the process of simple model building and teach you, and not just to run over it to make it work.

Enjoy!
